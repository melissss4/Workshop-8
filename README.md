Notes from workshop:
API’s we can use:

We are using JSON (the javascript response type)
The base of what we need to work with api’s

Website with a lot of free api’s

Objective:
Create a sketch that makes an API call to gather data from an external source. Here is a list of free-to-use APIs, Links to an external site. which do not require authentication.
Visual elements of the sketch should be determined by data retrieved from the external source.

Current sketch: https://melissss4.github.io/Workshop-8/ 


At first I wanted to add onto my previous workshop and just add in an API function, however I realised that with the buttons for the ‘create poem’ functions, adding in another button that says ‘push for image’ to grab an image from an api, would look very busy and when I tried it, I got very confused with all of the different button functions and decided to just start from scratch. I knew I wanted to have an API that would generate a random image, so I looked through the website provided: https://mixedanalytics.com/blog/list-actually-free-open-no-auth-needed-apis/ 
And I ended up choosing this API https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random. I liked that it did not have many restrictions so I would be able to easily incorporate it into my code without needing to worry about too many variables. 

I looked through this website to learn more about API’s https://medium.spatialpixel.com/simple-api-calls-f5bc0a9d579c and how they work. 

I also got a but unsure if the code needed to be altered when using an image fetching API, so I looked for some P5.Js sketches that use image fetching API’s and found one that was using the same API as me. https://editor.p5js.org/JLizardo019/sketches/53f2j_Xog  I realised I would not need to make too many changes to my code. 

I did decide to test and see if I would be able to add in a button, so that when the button was pushed, the image would be fetched. I am now quite familiar with the button function, so I found it easy enough to add in. 

After watching a couple of those video’s and reading the article on how API’s work, I wanted to add in a promise rejection handler. I looked at some websites like https://javascript.info/promise-error-handling and https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/reject and decided I would try add that in as well. I added it at the end of my code.

I think I would like to work with API’s more, and maybe figure out how to use API’s that need key words written into a text box search function to call upon a related image.
